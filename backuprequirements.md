# Data backup requirements

All lab members must have plans in place for data backup.
Backups should occur regularly!
Please make use of being able to [rsync](remotecopy) files between various lab machines and/or external drives.
Also make use of your [Google Drive](googledrive) account.

It is hard to overestimate the importance of backing up!
Data loss does occur and can be quite disruptive.
Even if you have all the best practices in place, you could need a lot of time to regenerate large files.
In the worst cases, you may lose irreplaceable files.
Let's try to avoid all of this!
