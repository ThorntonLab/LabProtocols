## Content generation using R Markdown

[R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) is a great way to generate various types of content.
In addition to generating [research reports](generatingreports), you can also use it for slides, papers, etc..

We have a set of template repositories that help kick-start content generation.
A template repository is a `GitHub` repository that can be used to seed a new repository.
Unlike forking, the commit history of the template doesn't transfer to the new repository, starting your new presentation with a clean history.

To use a template repository, go to its `GitHub` page, click `Use this repository` (green button near top right) and follow the instructions.
