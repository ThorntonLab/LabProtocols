# Thornton lab protocols

This page discusses a combination of guidelines/expectations for lab members as well as specific protocols or "recipes" for carrying out your work.

The contents are a work in progress!

## Working remotely

We often need to do our work on servers that are in a different location from us.
One example of this remote work is working from home, but we often work remotely when on campus.
For example, the campus cluster is in a different building from the lab.

* [Logging in with `ssh`](ssh)
* [Maintaining a persistent session on a remote server](multiplexers)
* [Mounting a remote file system](remotefs)
* [Copying files to/from remote servers](remotecopy)
* [VPN access to campus](vpn)

## Note-taking, lab notebooks, and "reports"

During the course of your research, you need to document your activities in the form of a "lab notebook".
In fact, you will probably have a few different lab notebooks.
You may have one that is like a "journal" of ideas for projects, notes on the progress of current projects, etc..
You will probably also have a set of notebooks that report on your results.
These reports will be mixtures of text, code, and graphics.
These reports will for the basis of how you share data with the lab, generate slides for talks, and write manuscripts.

(These tools are also pretty useful for teaching.
For example, I use note-taking software to track errors in the textbooks we use.)
