# Thornton lab protocols

This page discusses a combination of guidelines/expectations for lab members as well as specific protocols or "recipes" for carrying out your work.

The content here takes a while to learn about and to absorb into your daily work flow.
It is important to keep in mind that the time spent learning new skills pays off later by automating certain tasks and/or avoiding serious pitfalls that may stymie your work.
Much of what is discussed here is the result of many years of making mistakes.
A big goal here is to impart some of that "wisdom" on to you!

Many of the methods discussed here facilitate scientific collaboration.
You will collaborate with scientists within the lab, the department, and from other institutions.
We need methods in place to facilitate those collaborations.
These methods include how we share data, code, and results.

Finally, some of these things are just required of you!
These requirements will be made explicit via a link to a `Requirements` page for each subsection having requirements.

The contents are a work in progress!

## Working remotely

We often need to do our work on servers that are in a different location from us.
One example of this remote work is working from home, but we often work remotely when on campus.
For example, the campus cluster is in a different building from the lab.

* [Logging in with `ssh`](ssh)
* [Maintaining a persistent session on a remote server](multiplexers)
* [Mounting a remote file system](remotefs)
* [Copying files to/from remote servers](remotecopy)
* [VPN access to campus](vpn)

## Note-taking, lab notebooks, and "reports"

During the course of your research, you need to document your activities in the form of a "lab notebook".
In fact, you will probably have a few different lab notebooks.
You may have one that is like a "journal" of ideas for projects, notes on the progress of current projects, etc..
You will probably also have a set of notebooks that report on your results.
These reports will be mixtures of text, code, and graphics.
These reports will for the basis of how you share data with the lab, generate slides for talks, and write manuscripts.

(These tools are also pretty useful for teaching.
For example, I use note-taking software to track errors in the textbooks we use.)
