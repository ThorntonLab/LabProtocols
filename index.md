# Thornton lab protocols

This page discusses a combination of guidelines/expectations for lab members as well as specific protocols or "recipes" for carrying out your work.

The contents are a work in progress!

## Working remotely

We often need to do our work on servers that are in a different location from us.
One example of this remote work is working from home, but we often work remotely when on campus.
For example, the campus cluster is in a different building from the lab.
