This page discusses a combination of guidelines/expectations for lab members as well as specific protocols or "recipes" for carrying out your work.

The content here takes a while to learn about and to absorb into your daily work flow.
It is important to keep in mind that the time spent learning new skills pays off later by automating certain tasks and/or avoiding serious pitfalls that may stymie your work.
Much of what is discussed here is the result of many years of making mistakes.
A big goal here is to impart some of that "wisdom" on to you!

Many of the methods discussed here facilitate scientific collaboration.
You will collaborate with scientists within the lab, the department, and from other institutions.
We need methods in place to facilitate those collaborations.
These methods include how we share data, code, and results.

Finally, some of these things are just required of you!
These requirements will be made explicit via a link to a `Requirements` page for each subsection having requirements.

The contents are a work in progress!
