# Google Drive

Your `UCI` account is managed by a Google [Gsuite](https://gsuite.google.com/) account.
With it comes a **huge** amount of Google Drive space!
Please use/abuse this space for backing up data, especially large files!

The main problem with Google Drive is that transfer can be quite slow.
It is usually best to start your transfer late in the day and hope it is done by the next morning.

For `Windows` and `macOS` users, Google provides [apps](https://www.google.com/intl/en_jm/drive/download/) for you.
These apps facilitate regular backup from your personal machines.

Sadly, things are harder for `Linux`.
Both the [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org) and [KDE](https://www.kde.org) file managers support "mounting" a Google [drive](drive) account.
For `GNOME` on `PopOS!`, you can do this via `Online Accounts` under `Settings`.
The file manager integration lets you browse your Drive files and "drag and drop" new files to your Drive.

To the best of my knowledge, there is no way to interact with a Google Drive via the terminal.

## Command line utilities

There are several command line tools for syncing to Google Drive.
I currently don't have enough info to recommend one over another.
I have used `gdrive` in the past.
It did the job, but was "quirky".
However, `gdrive` seems to have evolved a lot and so I'll reserve judgement.
