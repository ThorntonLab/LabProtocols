# Lab notebook requirements

`PhD` students in the lab must learn one or both of `R Markdown` and/or `Jupyter`.
You will need these tools for sharing results in a digestible fashion with your advisor, the lab, and your committee.
For example, you can send out research reports to the committee prior to the meeting.
You may also wish to use `R Markdown` for writing manuscripts.

See [here](generatingreports) for KT's recommendations on these tools and a general description.
